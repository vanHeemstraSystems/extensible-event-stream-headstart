# Extensible Event Stream (XES) - Headstart

## 100 - Introduction

Based on "Extensible Event Stream (XES)" at https://xes-standard.org/

An Extensible Event Stream (XES) instance corresponds to a file-based event log or a formatted event stream that can be used to transfer event-driven data in a unified and extensible manner from a first site to a second site. Typically, the first site will be the site generating this event-driven data (for example, workflow systems, case handling systems, procurement systems, devices like wafer steppers and X-ray machines, and hospitals) while the second site will be the site analyzing this data (for example, by data scientists and/or advanced software systems).
